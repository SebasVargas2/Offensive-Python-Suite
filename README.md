# Cybersecurity Offensive Python Suite

A collection of Python scripts designed to explore and demonstrate common offensive security techniques in a controlled, educational environment.  
The goal of this project is to show how different attack vectors can be implemented in Python, and how defenders can harden their systems to detect and mitigate them.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer**  
> This project is for educational and ethical testing purposes only.  
> Do not use any of these scripts on systems you do not own or do not have explicit permission to test.

## Features

This suite currently includes scripts related to:

- Keylogging and input capture
- Reverse and bind shells
- Simple C2-style command execution
- Port scanning and basic network enumeration
- File transfer and simple exfiltration
- Persistence and basic evasion techniques (limited, for demo purposes)

Each module is kept as simple and readable as possible, so learners can focus on understanding the core concept.

## Project Goals

This project was created to:

1. Practice and improve my **Python** skills in real-world security scenarios.  
2. Demonstrate how offensive tools are built, so blue teams can better understand, detect and defend against them.  
3. Serve as a learning resource for junior security professionals interested in **offensive security, red teaming and malware development basics**.
